=== Filtering Data an Integration Works With
You can add a step to an integration to filter the data that the
integration operates on. In a filter step, {prodname} inspects the
data and continues the integraton only if the content meets
criteria that you define. For example, in an integration that
obtains data from Twitter, you can specify that you want to
operate on data only when the tweet contains "Red Hat".
