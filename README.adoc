_Q. I'm new to Asciidoc. How do I get this stuff to work?_

This project is configured to build the docs using the `asciidoctor-maven-plugin` and tooltips are extracted using the `syndesis-documentation-maven-plugin`.
Before you build the docs for the first time, build and install the `syndesis-documentation-maven-plugin` locally, as follows:

----
cd tools
mvn install
----

To build the docs, run Maven from the top-level directory, as follows:

----
mvn package
----

_Q. Where can I learn about Asciidoc syntax?_

See the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[Asciidoc User Manual].
